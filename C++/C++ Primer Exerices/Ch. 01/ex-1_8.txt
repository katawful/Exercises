Question: indicate what if any lines are legal. Compile a program with each line to test, correcting any errors

std::cout << "/*";
	This line is legal. While it uses a start comment pair, it is contained in the string literal that is printed by cout
	I was correct, it compiled correctly
std::cout << "*/";
	This line is legal. It is the same as the last line but instead uses a comment pair end. It is in the string literal
	I was correct, it compiled correctly
std::cout << /* "*/" */;
	This line is legal. It is effectively commenting out the "*/" characters. Removing the comments the line effectively becomes
	std::cout << ;
	which should compile
	I was wrong for this line. I was thinking more literally than what comment pairs actually do
	What happened is that the first end pair was found and that was the end of the comment. 
	So in reality the script was not legal
	I can change this by removing the first end pair brace.
	I was wrong on that as well. I simply just needed an ending quotation mark right before the semicolon.
std::cout << /* "*/" /* "/*" */;
	This line is not legal since it has a comment pair nest. That is not a legal thing
	I was wrong for this line. Like the last line, I wasn't think how comment pairs actually work.
	Comment pairs search for the first end brace, no others matter. Because of this there is a valid string literal for cout.
