Explain this loop:

constexpr int size = 5;
int ia[size] = {1,2,3,4,5}
for (int *ptr = ia, ix = 0; ix != size && ptr != ia+size; ++ix, ++ptr)
	{/*-----*/}

This loop is essentially doing the same thing twice.
ptr is used to go through an array as a ptr while ix is used to go through the array as an iterator.
The comma operator will simply finish working as is.
