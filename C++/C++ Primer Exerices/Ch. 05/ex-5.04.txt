Explain the following and correct any problems if any:

a) while (string::iterator iter != s.end ()) { /*...*/ }
This is a while loop that defines the variable iter as a string type then compares it to the output of s.end

b) while (bool status = find(word) )) { /*...*/ }
	if (!status) { /*...*/ }
This is a while loop that defines the variable "status", and initializes it with the find(word).
That variable is then used in an if block outside of the while block.
That variable is not defined within the scope of the if block.
To change that, status needs to be defined before the while block:

bool status;
while (status = find(word)) { /*...*/ }
	if (!status) { /*...*/ }
