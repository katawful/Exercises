Correct the errors in the provided coded:

a) This code never contains any breaks after each case.
This means that the code will try to process each case even if they don't match.
This means that the default case will always run.
To fix this add a break statement in-between each case like so:

...
switch (ch) {
	case 'a': aCnt++; break;
	case 'e': eCnt++; break;
	default: iouCnt++; break;
}

b) This script is illegal.
The second case in the switch is trying to set a value of ix that isn't in scope.
To fix it, initialize the respective value outside of the switch like so:

...
int ix = get_value();
switch (index){
	case 1:
		ivec[ix] = index;
		break;
	default:
		ix = ivec.size() - 1;
		ivec[ix] = index;
}

c)
