Explain the following for loops. Correct any mistakes:

a) 
for (int ix = 0; ix != sz; ++ix) (/*...*/}
if (ix != sz)

This loop prefix increments ix until the value of ix is equal to sz.
The if statement cannot work however since ix was initialized in the for header.
Initialize ix above the for loop to fix it.

b)
int ix;
for (ix != sz; ++ix) {/*...*/}

This for loop iterates until ix is equal to sz.
The header is wrong however, its missing a component. 
The initialize component needs to be a null statement, add a ; before ix != sz

c)
for (int ix = 0; ix != sz; ++ix, ++ sz) {/*...*/}

This loop Iterates
