Explain the following loops, correct any problems you detect.

a)
do
  int v1, v2;
  cout << "Please enter two numbers to sum:" ;
  if (cin >> v1 >> v2)
    cout << "Sum is: " << v1 + v2 << endl;
while (cin);

This loop has the user insert two numbers and sums them.
This never actually can read from 'cin'.
The do statement is also never contained

b)
do {
  //...
while (int ival = get_response());
This doesn't work, we cannot declare a variable within the condition.

c)
do {
  int ival = get_response();
} while (ival);
This is sound.
It waits until get_response() gives a falsy value
