Rewrite the following old casts to use the proper named casts:

int i; double d; const string *ps; char *pc; void *pv;

a) pv = (void*)ps;
pv = const_cast<string*>(ps)

b) i = int(*pc);
i = static_cast<int*>(pc);

c) pv = &d;
pv = static_cast<void*>(&d);

d) pc = (char*) pv;
pc = static_cast<char*>(pv);
This is supposed to be reinterpret_cast for some reason
I don't get this section at all
