Question: Determine the types in each of the following then right a program to see if you were right.

const int i = 42;
auto j = i; const auto &k = i; auto *p = &i;
const auto j2 = i, &k2 = i;
 
j would be just an int, the top-level const from i isn't carried.
	right prediction
k would be a constant reference to the constant object i.
	right prediction
p would be a pointer to the non-const object i.
	wrong prediction, p is a pointer to a constant int, that can't be changed
j2 would be a constant int.
	right prediction
k2 would be a constant reference to the constant object i.
	right prediction
