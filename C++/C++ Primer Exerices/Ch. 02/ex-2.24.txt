Question: Why is the initialization of p legal but lp not legal?

int i = 42; void *p = &i; long *lp = &i;
 
The initialization of p is legal because we are defining it as a void* pointer, it doesn't have a type. The initialization of lp is illegal because we are trying to define a long pointer
with an integer object. That isn't possible.
