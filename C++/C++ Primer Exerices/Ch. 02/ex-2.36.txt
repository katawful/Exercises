Question: Determine the type for each variable and its value when the code finishes.

int a = 3, b = 4;
decltype(a) c = a;
decltype((b)) d = a;
++c;
++d;
 
a and b are integers.
c would be an integer assigned to a
d would be a reference assigned to a

After the code is done:
a = 4
b = 4
c = 5
d = 4
