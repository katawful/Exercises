Question: Indicate whether the object being declared has top or low level const:

const int v2 = 0; int v1 = v2;
v2 has top-level const, v1 will not have top-level const.
int *p1 = &v1, &r1 = v1;
p1 will not have top-level const, but r1 can't be bound since it is an int&.
const int *p2 = &v2, *const p3 = &i, &r2 = v2;
p2 will have low-level const, p3 will have low-level and top-level const, r2 will have low-level const.
