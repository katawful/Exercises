Question: Explain the following defintions. If any are illegal explain why.

int i = 0;
(a) double *dp = &i;
This is illegal because we are creating a pointer with a different type from the address we are assigning it 
(b) int *ip = i;
This is illegal because we haven't initialize what address the pointer points to. Initializing it with an integer is invalid.
(c) int *p = &i;
This is legal.
