Question: explain if the following are definitions or declarations

(a) extern int ix = 1024;
This is a definition. Since a declaration only provides a name and type, initializing with a value defines it. It is also invalid.
(b) int iy;
This is a definition. We didn't specify that we wanted a declaration so we've allocated memory to it, just didn't initialize it.
(c) extern int iz;
This is a declaration. We used the extern keyword and didn't try to initialize the variable.
