Question: Which definitions, if any, are invalid?

(a) int ival = 1.01;
This is valid, albeit truncated.
(b) int &rval1 = 1.01;
This is invalid, you can't define a reference to a literal.
(c) int &rval2 = ival;
This is valid.
(d) int &rval3;
This is invalid, a reference must be initialized to another object.
