Question: Which of the following names, if any, are invalid?

(a) int double = 3.14;
This is invalid because double is a built-in name
(b) int _;
This is valid.
(c) int catch-22;
This is invalid since "-" isn't a valid character for an identifier
(d) int 1_or_2 = 1;
This is valid.
(e) double Double = 3.14;
This is invalid because Double is a built-in name, C++ is not case-sensitive in this case.
