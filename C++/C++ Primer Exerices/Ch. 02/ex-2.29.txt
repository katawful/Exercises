Question: Using the variables in the previous question, which of the following assignments are legal? Explain.

(a) i = ic;
This is legal. We are assigning an object to the value of the const int ic.
(b) p1 = p3;
This is legal. We are assigning a non-const pointer to a const pointer that points to a const object.
(c) p1 = &ic;
This is legal. We can assign an object to a non-const pointer.
(d) p3 = &ic;
This is illegal. p3 is a const pointer and can't change its value.
(e) p2 = p1;
This is illegal. p2 is a const pointer and can't change its value.
(f) ic = *p3;
This is illegal. ic is a constant object and its value can't change.
