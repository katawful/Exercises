Question: Assume txt_size takes no arguments and return an int value, which of the following are illegal?
 
unsigned buf_size = 1024;
(a) int ia[buf_size];
This is legal. 
(b) int ia[4 * 7 - 14];
This is legal. 
(c) int ia[txt_size()];
This is legal? 
(d) char st[11] = "fundamental";
This is illegal. The string literal "fundamental" is 11 characters but since it's a string literal it has an addtional null character.
The array is only 11 values big.
