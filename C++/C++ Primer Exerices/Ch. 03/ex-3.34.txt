Question: Given that p1 and p2 point to elements in the same array, what does the following code do? Are there values of p1 and p2 that make this code illegal?

p1 += p2 - p1;

This code would compound add the difference in pointer to arrays between p2 and p1 and add it to p1 since they are in the same array.
This operation would be illegal if p2 is smaller than p1 and the resulting difference would return a value less than 0.
You can't address a negative pointer to an array even though the code does allow it.
