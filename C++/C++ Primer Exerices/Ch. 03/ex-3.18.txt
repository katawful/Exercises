Question: Is the following legal? If not how would you fix it?

vector<int> ivec;
ivec[0] = 42;
 
This isn't legal. ivec is currently empty so you can't use a subscript to assign a value to it. Since we are just assigning the first element in the vector
I would simply use a push_back operation to add the desired element like so:

vector<int> ivec;
ivec.push_back(42);
