Question: Identify errors in the following code
 
constexpr size_t array_size = 10;	// array size variable
int ia[array_size];
for (size_t ix = 1; ix <= array_size; ++ix)
      ia[ix] = ix;
      This is not legal. Indices start at 0 not 1. This will cause unexpected behavior.
      The array goes up to the index value of 9, not the value of array_size which is 10.
      The program will likely function to some degree, but it will not work properly.
