Question: What would happen if you were to define the loop control variable in 3.6 as type char?

With the loop control variable being of type char, we wouldn't be able to change the string we are processing. The loop control variable
just reads each character and assigns it to the loop control variable. We need to directly access the characters in the string by
referencing them. As a result, if we were to make this change we wouldn't be able to printthe correct output.
