Question: List some drawbacks of using arrays over vectors.

An array is of fixed size and type. Once the size is created, values can't be added to the array unlike vectors.
Arrays default initialized with built-in types inside a function return undefined values, while vectors do not.
When list initializing, the list cannot exceed the size of the array. For string literals this becomes a problem wrt to null characters.
