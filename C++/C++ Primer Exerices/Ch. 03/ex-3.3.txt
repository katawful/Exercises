In the string input operator, whitespace characters are ignored. So if one would write a program block such as the following:

while (cin >> stringInput) {
	cout << stringInput
}

and type in "Hello World!" as the input, the output would be "HelloWorld!". Each character is read besides the whitespace character.
With getline() however, if one were to create a program block like the following:

while (getline(cin, stringInput)) {
	cout << stringInput

and type in "Hello World!" as the input, the output would be "Hello World!". getline() reads the entire line of input up until a 
newline character, meaning that whitespace characters are not ignored.
