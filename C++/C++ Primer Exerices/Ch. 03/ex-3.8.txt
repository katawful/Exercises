Question: Which of the three approaches do you prefer? Why?

I prefer the ranged for loop approach. It is much more simple compared to a basic for loop and a 
while loop. The while loop requires an iterator and a comparative object to be created, and 
functionally it isn't any different from a basic for loop. The basic for loop is a more simple than
that, but compared to a ranged for loop it is far more complex. The range for loop lets me simply
just access the required character reference then change it without worrying about the conditions
to loop.
