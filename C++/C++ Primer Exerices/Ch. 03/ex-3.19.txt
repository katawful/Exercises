You can define a vector and give it 10 elements of value 42 many ways:

First way:

vector<int> v1(10, 42);

Second way:

vector<int> v2;
for ( i = 1; i <= 10; ++i) {
	v2.push_back(42);

Third way:

vector<int> v3{42,42,42,42,42,42,42,42,42,42};

Of these, the first way is the best way to solve this issue. It is the simplest in terms of code
and also leads to less errors from miscounting or creating a for loop wrong.
