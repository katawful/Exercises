A postfix increment/decrement would end up trying to evaluate an invalid object.
The postfix increment/decrement does that but returns the unchanged value.
This would lead to the program trying to evaluate the size of an object that's smaller than it actually is.
This would fail.
You would have to increase the value of ivec.size so that we can finish the program.
