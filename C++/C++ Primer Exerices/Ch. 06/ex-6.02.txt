a)
int f() {
  string s;
  //...
  return s;
}
This function is not in error, but seemingly does nothing as it has no parameter.

b)
f2(int i) {/* ... */}
This function is in error, the function has no type and needs one

c) 
int calc(int v1, int v1) {/* ... */}
The parameters have the same name, one needs to be changed

d) double square(double x) return x = x;
There isn't a function body, there needs to be one
