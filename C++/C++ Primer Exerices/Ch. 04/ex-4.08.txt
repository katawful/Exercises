Explain when the operands are evaluated in logical AND, logical OR, and equality operators:

In logical AND, operands are evaluated left to right. The right value is only evaluated if the left side returns true.
In logical OR, operands are also evaluated left to right. The right value is only evaluated if the left side returns false.
In equality operators the left side is evaluated first, converted to a bool if needed.
