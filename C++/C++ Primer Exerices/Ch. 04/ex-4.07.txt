Question: What does overflow mean? Show 3 examples that will overflow

Overflow is when a value of a certain type exceeds its limits on either end.
In arithmetic types, there are limits for every type.

Examples:

1)
short x = 32767;
x += 1;

This overflows as the maximum value of a signed short is 32767

2)
unsigned int x = 0;
x -= 1;

This overflows as the minimum value of an unsigned int is 0

3)
short x = 30000
x = x * 3000
This overflows as it exceeds the maximum size of a signed short
