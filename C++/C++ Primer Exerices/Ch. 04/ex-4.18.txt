Quesiton: What would happen to this while loop if a prefix increment was used?

auto pbeg v.begin();
while (pbeg != v.end() && *beg >= 0)
	cout << *pbeg++ << endl;

If a prefix increment were to be used then we wouldn't ever print the value we wanted to.
Say our vector contains {1,2,3}.
With the postfix increment we would start the first loop with printing 1 since we used the unchanged value.
A prefix increment would instead print 2 since we would have printed that changed value from incrementing.
The first value would be skipped outright.
It would also try to print values that don't exist inside the vector.
In the last loop, the postfix increment would post the value of 3.
However, the prefix increment already posted 3 in the last loop, but it would still try to print a next value.
