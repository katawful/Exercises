Although the following are legal, they probably do not behave as they programmer expects. Why? Rewrite the expressions as you think they should be.

a) if (p = getPtr() != 0)
Assignments have low priority. What this condition is doing is checking the outcome of getPtr() != 0 then assign that value to p.
It should be: if ((p = getPtr) != 0) for the intended functionality.

b) if (i = 1024)
This condition seems to be a mistake of assignment for equality. While legal it would return true.
It would make more sense as: if (i == 1024)
