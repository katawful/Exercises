What are the values of i and d after each assignment?

int i; double d;

a) d = i = 3.5

i would be 3 since we are assigning the literal 3.5 and that truncates for type int.
d would then be 3 as well since we lost data in the truncation.

b) i = d = 3.5

d would be 3.5 since we are assigning 3.5 to it.
i would then be 3 since we are assigning the value of d (3.5) to it which then gets truncated.
