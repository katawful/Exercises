Question: Explain the difference between prefix and postfix increment/decrement

Prefix increment/decrement change the value then return the changed value.
int i = 0;
++i;
This increment would return 1.

Postfix increment/decrement change the value but return the unchanged value.
int i = 0;
i++;
This increment would return 0.
