Question: The following assigment is illegal. Why? How would you correct it?

double dval; int ival; int *pi;
dval = ival = pi = 0

This is illegal because we are attempting to assign an int to a pointer to an int. They both can take the literal value of 0.
To fix this I would do something like this:

dval = ival = 0; pi = 0

We can assign a double to the value of an int and the pointer to an int pi will get assigned its own value.
